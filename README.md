# CSCI-335
Projects in C++ that I created during my Junior year.

## Project 1: Shared Pointer & Unique Pointer
Implementation of Shared Pointer and Unique Pointer classes from scratch.
Goal of the implementation was to learn about the "Big 5" rule (c++11)

## Project 2: Spell Checker
Spell Checker program that analyzes an input text file.
The text is being checked for different possible errors (swapped neighboring letters, missing letter, extra letter, and replaced letter).
The words are being compared with a dictionary.
Goal of this project is to learn about the runtime of different containers (vector VS set VS unordered set).
*The program ran three different options for the dictionary's container.

## Project 3: FastQueue
Implementation of a queue class with vector as an underlying constructor.
Goal was to make the queue as efficient as possible with O(1) complexity for all functions.
